# Image-Segmentation-UNET
I am building a UNET Model for image Segmenttation using the ADE20k dataste available at https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/
Semantic image segmentation is the name for this type of image classification. By identifying each pixel in an image with its appropriate class, semantic image segmentation allows us to anticipate an exact mask for each item in the picture. The term "semantic" relates to what is being represented; for example, a dark blue mask may represent the "Car" class, whereas the a red mask indicates "Person" class.
